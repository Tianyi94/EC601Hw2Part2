# EC601Hw2 Part2
This is part2 for homework2.
At first I tried to add the storage funtion on my website. However, after I read the example and made some tries, I find out it would be too hard to do that. As for chat there is a tutorial to teach how to do this step by step, I just follow it.
In this part, I realized user sign-in(Using google account), send message, read message, send image and show notifications.
To run this program, just download this folder and run "firebase use --add""firebase serve", the result will be in http://localhost:5000.
