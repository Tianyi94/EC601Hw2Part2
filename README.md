# EC601Hw2 Part2
# Trello: https://trello.com/b/WVPPJihH/ec601-hw2
This is part2 for homework2.<br />
At first I tried to add the storage funtion on my website. However, after I read the example and made some tries, I find out it would be too hard to do that. As for chat there is a tutorial to teach how to do this step by step, I just follow it.<br />
In this part, I realized user sign-in(Using google account), send message, read message, send image and show notifications.<br />
The website of friendly chat is available at https://ec602hw2part2.firebaseapp.com/.<br />
To run this program, just download this folder and run "firebase use --add""firebase serve", the result will be in http://localhost:5000.
# Unit Test:
As homework 5 requires, I have done three parts.<br />
The first part is the auto test of my friendly chat. I used monkeytest and the result is in https://monkeytest.it/test/e59810e3-bbfb-45d1-972e-2fd8e620b59e. It reports some problem in sign-in part. But I think this is due to the reason that it doesn't use a google account to login.<br />
The second part is the test case sheet done by myself. I put the sheet in a excel file in the Unittest folder. I test my personal website (Part 1 in Hw2) and Friendly Chat(Part 2 in Hw2). All the tests pass.<br />
I also learned to test android app. As I didn't make app before, I tested the app of the group which I did code review using monkey. The result is saved in the txt file in the UnitTest folder.
